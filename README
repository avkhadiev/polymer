# Molecular Dynamics simulation of a rigid polymer molecule
## Synopsis
A molecular dynamics simulation of a single polymer molecule with fixed bond
lengths and an arbitrary number of bonds.
## Motivation
The simulation generates equilibrium configurations of the molecule. These
configurations serve as the end points of geodesic paths in the configuration
space of the molecule.
